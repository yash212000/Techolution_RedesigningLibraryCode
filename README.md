Techolution Assignment - Redesigning poor code of Library Management System \
Submitted by- Yash Vardhan Goel \
**How to run this code:**  \
1)Just run the “library_updated.py file” on your system, rest other classes are defined within it.\
2)Make sure while adding a book, you enter a valid ISBN number, otherwise it will throw a warning of invalid ISBN.\
(To verify an ISBN, calculate 10 times the first digit, plus 9 times the second digit, plus 8 times the third digit and so on until we add 1 time the last digit. If the final number leaves no remainder when divided by 11, the code is a valid ISBN.)\
Some examples of valid ISBN are:\
1259060977\
0747532745
